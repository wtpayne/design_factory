Process improvement plan template
=================================

This appendix is a MANDATORY part of the (SDSMCS). 
It provides the content requirements for the process 
improvement plan (PIP).

#. If the section numbering used below is not used,
   the developer SHALL provide an appendix in the 
   PIP with a traceability matrix mapping from the 
   section numbers and titles in the PIP template 
   below to the section numbers and titles used
   in the developer PIP.
#. If there is such a traceability mapping appendix,
   it SHALL be referenced in Section 1.3.
   
Note 1
  The information below is consistent with
  the Software Development Standard for Mission
  Critical Systems (SDSMCS), especially Section
  5.25.


Purpose
^^^^^^^

The PIP is an integrated plan covering the software
development process improvement activities for all
software team members throughout the system
development life cycle. The PIP provides the plans
and activities to improve the processes on the
project based on process assessments conducted
by the acquirer team or the developer team or
both.

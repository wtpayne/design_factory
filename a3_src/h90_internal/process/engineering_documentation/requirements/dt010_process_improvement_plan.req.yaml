      .. [#ARC] High-maturity organizations are appraised
         by an Appraisal Requirements for CMMI (ARC)
         Class A SCAMPI appraisal as practicing and
         successfully rated by an independent CMMI
         Institute-certified High Maturity Lead Appraiser,
         as Maturity Level 4 or 5, including all 20 or
         22 CMMI-DEV V1.3 process areas, respectively.
         The Level 4 CMMI high-maturity process areas
         are: Organizational Process Performance (OPP)
         and Quantitative Project Management (QPM);
         the Level 5 process areas are: Causal Analysis
         and Resolution (CAR) and Organizational
         Performance Management (OPM).

         service mark of Carnegie Mellon University.

      .. [SHALL] The use of the word SHALL indicates
         that the statement is intended to be a
         contractually binding requirement, and that
         it should be both implemented and verified
         before the requirement is considered to be
         met.

      .. [WILL] The use of the word WILL indicates
         that the statement is intended to describe
         a fact or an assurance that some condition
         may be assumed to be true. This can be used
         to communicate obligations that have been
         accepted by other parties or to highlight
         relevant legeslation, standards, or current
         system capabilities. WILL statements are
         neither subject to verification nor to
         validation and are not intended to be
         contractually binding.

      .. [SHOULD] The use of the word SHOULD indicates
         that the statement is either intended to
         communicate a provision that cannot be
         formally verified for some reason, or a
         design goal that is desired but not certain
         to be fully achievable. SHOULD statements are
         not subject to verification, and are therefore
         not contractually binding, but they are still
         subject to validation and user acceptance
         testing.

      .. [MAY] The use of the word MAY indicates that
         the statement is advisory, intended to grant
         explicit permission for some design decision
         or to suggest a potential design decision
         without making it mandatory. MAY statements
         place no obligation on either party and are
         neither subject to verification nor to
         validation

      .. [NEED] The use of the word NEED indicates
         that the statement is intended to express
         a high level stakeholder expectation, goal
         or need. Such statements are not requirements,
         although requirements may be derived from
         them. NEED statements are neither subject to
         verification nor to validation.

This document provides definitions for key terms 
used in the Stableflow documentation.


Actor model
  A computational model where components communicate
  through non-blocking message passing, allowing for
  concurrent execution but with nondeterministic
  behavior.

Computational model
  A formal model connecting desirable computational
  properties such as determinism to design decisions
  such as how components in a computational system
  communicate with one another.

Data flow
  A type of computational system where data moves
  through a system of connected components, with
  each component processing and transforming the
  data before passing it along.

Edge
  A connection between nodes in a Stableflow system
  that carries data either across a  network or 
  within a host.

Functional chain
  A connected sequence of nodes that together 
  implement a specific feature or capability of 
  the system.

Host
  A physical or virtual device that runs one or 
  more processes in a Stableflow system.

Kahn process network
  A computational model where components communicate 
  through blocking reads and non-blocking writes, 
  ensuring deterministic behavior regardless of
  timing.

Model driven engineering
  An approach to system development where the
  functionality of the system is first prototyped
  and validated as a model before being deployed
  to production.

Node
  A basic computational unit in Stableflow that 
  processes data. Nodes are connected by edges to
  form the system's data flow graph.

Process
  An execution context that contains one or more
  nodes, allowing for concurrent computation.

Product line engineering
  An approach to developing a family of related
  products using a common core architecture with
  systematic variations.

System configuration
  A specific configuration of a Stableflow system, 
  tailored for a particular use case, deployment 
  scenario, or client requirement. 

System variant
  A specific configuration of a Stableflow system, 
  tailored for a particular use case, deployment 
  scenario, or client requirement.

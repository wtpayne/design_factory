Stableflow software architecture description
============================================


1. Scope
--------


1.1 Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This software architecture description document
applies to the Stableflow framework, a platform
for designing and operating distributed systems.

The stableflow framework is a core part of the 
"Design factory", an opinionated approach to the
design and development of software intensive
systems.

1.2 System overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stableflow is a framework for designing and operating
distributed systems. 

It is most suited to continuously operating systems
that can be easily described in terms of data flows
or data processing pipelines. Such systems include
sensor data processing, autonomous vehicle control,
business process automation, "digital twin" simulation,
and other similar data-intensive systems.

The framework enables:

* Model driven design
* Design workflow automation
* Product line engineering
* Deterministic simulation and re-simulation
* Automatic transformation of system architecture specifications
* Automatic optimization of system design parameters

It is conceptually similar to tools like Simulink,
Labview, or Ptolemy, but with a greater focus on
interoperability with modern ML/AI models and tools.

Key use cases include:

* Distributed "cyber-physical" systems
* Systems of cooperating "agents"
* Systems requiring rigorous testing and simulation
* Building families of related systems with shared architecture
* Projects where architectural exploration and optimization are key concerns

The ideas behind stableflow have been developed 
since the late 2000s and early 2010s and are based
on experiences developing machine vision systems
for aerospace, automative and maritime autonomy
applications.

Experiences with using MATLAB, Simulink and rational
Rhapsody for model driven engineering highlighted 
some critical issues with these tools, including:

* Restrictions placed on system architecture and
  engineering team structure in order to work around
  the lack of support for usable textual diffing
  and merging of system designs in Simulink.
* Developers attempting to reverse engineer the
  model design from the desired generated code
  because of a lack of transparency and direct
  developer control over the generated code in
  both Rhapsody and Simulink.
* Difficulty in integrating the latest technical
  developments from the public domain due to
  the awkwardness of Python/MATLAB inter-operability.
* Administrative overhead associated with licensing
  and compliance for MATLAB and Simulink.
* RSI due to the heavy use of mouse-based interaction
  in Simulink.

On the other hand, attempting to do away with MDE
tools like Simulink and Rhapsody, coding directly
in C++ highlighted a different set of issues, including:

* Difficulty in communicating the architectural
  design to non-technical stakeholders without a
  "native" graphical representation. 
* Lack of support for simulation or resimulation
  making testing exceedingly difficult.
* Lack of a systematic approach to component composition
  and the generation of system variants for testing
  and simulation.

These experiences and lessons learned have informed
the development of Stableflow, which is mainly
intended to provide some of the benefits of MDE
without these drawbacks. Initially envisaged as
a sort of "Simulink-but-for-Python", as it has
developed, certain design decisions have pointed
towards a slightly more refined approach to MDE.

TODO: Discuss the influence of spinnaker, and the
      idea of the model as the equivalent of an
      HDL netlist, emphasiszing the importance of
      model transformations to achieve engineering
      goals.

TODO: Discuss automated / search-based optimization
      and the use of model transformations to help
      achieve this.

Stableflow has been developed as a public domain
project by William Payne with the eventual goal
of finding a commercial home for the project.

TODO: Discuss future plans for the project.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stableflow employs several key design patterns and principles:

* **Minimal Engine**: Core platform provides only essential capabilities:

  * Deterministic message passing (KPN)
  * Basic lifecycle management
  * Resource coordination

* **Model Transformation**: System functionality implemented through:

  * Configuration generation/modification
  * Node composition and connection

  * Hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc.)

* User Environment:

  * Command line interface
  * Configuration files
  * Monitoring and debugging tools


3. Detailed Design
------------------


3.1 Component Design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


System Component
""""""""""""""""

The System orchestrates the entire Stableflow SOI (System Of 
Interest). It manages the lifecycle of hosts and processes,
ensuring all components work together cohesively.

Key responsibilities:

* Starting and stopping the system
* Managing system-wide state
* Coordinating between hosts
* Handling system-level control signals


Host Component
""""""""""""""

A Host represents a physical or virtual processor capable of
running one or more execution contexts. Each host typically
corresponds to a single machine, device, or processor core.

Key responsibilities:

* Starting and stopping local processes
* Managing inter-process communication
* Managing local resources
* Handling control signals from the system


Process Component
"""""""""""""""""

A Process provides a single context of execution, running
nodes sequentially. Each process maps to either an operating
system process or thread (currently only OS processes are
supported).

Key responsibilities:

* Managing node execution order
* Handling inter-node communication
* Processing control signals
* Managing process-local resources


Node Component
""""""""""""""

A Node provides minimal functionality:

* Message buffer management
* Implementation invocation
* Basic lifecycle support

All higher-level capabilities (monitoring, testing, etc.) are
implemented by transforming the system model to insert
appropriate nodes.


Node Implementation
"""""""""""""""""""

Node implementations provide the actual behavior for nodes.
Currently supported in Python with two interface styles:

* **Functional**: Pure functions for lifecycle stages
* **Coroutine**: Generator functions for simpler state management


Edge Component
""""""""""""""

Edges represent message flows between nodes. Implementation
varies based on:

* Whether nodes are in same/different processes
* Whether nodes are on same/different hosts
* The computational model being used


3.2 Control Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


System Lifecycle
""""""""""""""""

The system progresses through several stages::

    │         Run          │                │     Pause     │
    │     (main loop)      │◄───────────────│               │
    │                      │     start      └──┬────────────┘
    └───────────┬──────────┘                   │         ▲
                │                              │         │
                │ stop                         │  step   │
                │                              └─────────┘
                ▼
    ┌──────────────────────┐
    │                      │
    │         Stop         │
    │  (cleanup/dispose)   │
    │                      │
    └──────────────────────┘

Lifecycle Stages:

1. **Configure**: Process configuration data, instantiate components
2. **Reset**: Initialize all nodes and allocate resources
3. **Run**: Execute nodes according to computational model
4. **Pause**: Optional state for debugging/inspection
5. **Stop**: Cleanup and dispose of resources


Control Signals
"""""""""""""""

The system uses several types of control signals:

* **Continue**: Normal execution should proceed
* **Exit**: 

  * Immediate: Non-recoverable error, terminate immediately
  * Controlled: Graceful shutdown requested

* **Reset**: Return to initial state
* **Pause/Step**: Debug execution control


3.3 Data Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Message Passing
"""""""""""""""

Data flows between nodes through messages passed along edges.
The exact mechanism depends on node locations:

* Same Process: Direct memory transfer
* Different Processes: Shared memory queues
* Different Hosts: Network communication (e.g., ZeroMQ)


Flow Control
""""""""""""

Message flow is governed by the computational model in use:

* **Kahn Process Networks**:

  * Nodes block on reading until data available
  * Writing never blocks
  * Deterministic behavior guaranteed

* **Actor Model** (planned):

  * Non-blocking reads and writes
  * Higher performance but non-deterministic

* **CSP** (under consideration):

  * Synchronized communication
  * Both reader and writer must be ready


4. Data Design
--------------


4.1 Data Structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The engine provides minimal core data structures, with additional
functionality implemented through model transformations.


Core Configuration Data
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Minimal configuration required by the engine:

* System topology:

  * Node definitions (inputs/outputs only)
  * Edge connections
  * Process assignments
  * Host mappings

* Implementation bindings:

  * Node implementation references
  * Edge implementation selection
  * Data type specifications

Extended configuration (e.g., for testing, monitoring, etc.) is
implemented through model transformations that augment this
basic structure.


Node State Management
"""""""""""""""""""""

Engine manages only essential node data:

* Input message buffers
* Output message buffers
* Implementation state container

Additional state management (e.g., checkpointing, debugging)
is implemented through transformed configurations that wrap
nodes with appropriate state management nodes.


4.2 Data Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Engine Storage
""""""""""""""

Core engine only handles:

* In-memory message queues
* Basic node state
* Active configuration


Extended Storage
""""""""""""""""

Additional storage capabilities provided through transformations:

* Recording nodes for data capture
* Replay nodes for data playback
* Monitor nodes for state inspection
* Checkpoint nodes for state persistence


4.3 Computational Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Kahn Process Networks (Primary)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Deterministic concurrency model
* Nodes communicate through unbounded FIFO channels
* Reading blocks until data available
* Writing never blocks
* Guarantees deterministic behavior


Actor Model (Planned)
"""""""""""""""""""""

* Asynchronous message passing
* Non-blocking operations

CSP Model (Under Consideration)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Synchronized communication
* Blocking read/write operations
* Direct node-to-node communication
* Suitable for tightly coupled processes


5. Interface Design
-------------------


5.1 External Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            state['count'] = 0
        else:
            state['count'] += 1
        outputs['output']['count'] = state['count']
        return (None,)  # Continue signal

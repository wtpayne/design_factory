High Level Requirements
------------------------

Stableflow Platform Architecture Principles.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The Stableflow platform SHALL be designed as a plurality of
  "layers", each of which has a well defined and consistent set 
  of responsibilities.

# The lower "foundational" Stableflow platform layers SHALL
  implement only those capabilities that cannot be effectively
  implemented at the higher and more "application-oriented" layers
  of the platform.

# The Stableflow platform SHALL maintain a clear separation
  between the responsibilities of each layer to ensure
  platform simplicity and testability.

# The Stableflow platform SHALL permit System Design Engineers
  to implement advanced capabilities through model transformations.

# The Stableflow platform core SHALL be limited to:
  * Basic message passing infrastructure
  * Node lifecycle management
  * Graph representation and manipulation
  * Execution control primitives

# Advanced capabilities such as fault tolerance, monitoring,
  logging, and performance optimization SHOULD be implemented
  through application-layer components and model transformations
  rather than built into the platform core.

Core Platform Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Systems of interest on the Stableflow platform SHALL be
  represented by a collection of one or more nodes.

# Nodes SHALL represent functional components of the system.

# Functional components SHALL communicate with each other via
  message passing.

# Message passing connections between functional components
  SHALL be represented by edges between nodes.

# Systems of interest on the Stableflow platform SHALL be
  represented by a directed graph of nodes and edges.

# Functional chains on the Stableflow platform SHALL be
  represented by connected subgraphs of the overall 
  system of interest graph.

# Functional chains on the Stableflow platform SHOULD be
  identified by labels on nodes.

# Functional chains WILL have both functional and non-functional
  requirements.

# Non-functional requirements for functional chains MAY include
  metrics such as latency, throughput, resource utilisation and
  efficiency.

(Re-)Simulation for functional quality assurance.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The Stableflow platform SHALL enable System Design Engineers
  to use re-simulation to reproduce and diagnose functional
  nonconformities in the functional behaviour of specific
  functional chains.

# The Stableflow platform SHALL allow System Design Engineers
  to design functional chains that have an execution semantics
  that is deterministic and repeatable.

# The Stableflow platform SHALL enable System Design Engineers
  to specify the execution semantics of functional chains
  within a system of interest.

# The Stableflow platform MAY allow System Design Engineers
  to design deterministic functional chains with an execution
  semantics that is equivalent to that of a Kahn process network.

# The Stableflow platform MAY allow System Design Engineers
  to design deterministic functional chains with an execution
  semantics that is equivalent to that of the Hoare Communicating
  sequential processes (CSP) model.

Optional nondeterministic semantics.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# When non-functional requirements demand that a functional
  chain have an execution semantics that is not supported by
  a deterministic computational semantics, AND when re-simulation
  is not a hard requirement for that functional chain, then the
  stableflow platform SHOULD allow system design engineers to
  select an alternative nondeterministic computational semantics
  for execution and message passing.

# The Stableflow platform MAY allow System Design Engineers
  to design nondeterministic functional chains with an execution
  semantics that is equivalent to that of an actor model.

Model transformations for product line engineering.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The Stableflow platform SHALL allow System Design Engineers to
  apply product line engineering methodologies to the design of
  (product lines of) systems of interest.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD allow System Design Engineers
  to define a "base" system of interest and a set of model
  transformations that can be applied to the base system to
  produce derived systems of interest in the same product line.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD allow System Design Engineers
  to define functional chains as independent systems of interest
  and a set of model transforms that can be applied to a set of
  functional chains to produce compound systems in the same
  product line.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD allow System Design Engineers
  to design model transformations that mutate the directed
  graph representing a system of interest.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD allow System Design Engineers
  to design model transformations that combine a plurality of
  directed graphs representing systems of interest to produce
  compound systems of interest.

# The Stableflow platform SHALL allow model transformation
  scripts to mutate and combine the directed graphs that
  represent systems of interest.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD represent the directed graphs
  that represent systems of interest as a mutable in-memory
  data structure.

# The Stableflow platform SHOULD allow System Design Engineers
  to write model transformation scripts in a language of their
  own choosing.

# The Stableflow platform MAY restrict the languages that
  can be used for model transformation scripts to those
  that allow the system of interest directed graph data
  structure to be serialised in some commonly understood
  data serialisation format such as JSON, YAML, or XML.

# The Stableflow platform MAY provide a simple API for model
  transformation scripts to use that consists of only a pair
  of methods for getting and setting the system of interest
  directed graph data structure in a serialised format.

# If a simple API is provided, then the Stableflow Platform 
  SHOULD make the simple API available in a common and programming
  languages agnostic manner, e.g. through a command line interface
  or an HTTP API, or a native shared library interface.

# The Stableflow platform MAY provide an extended API for
  model transformation scripts to use that consists of a
  set of methods for querying and manipulating the system
  of interest directed graph data structure e.g. adding and
  removing nodes and edges in a manner similar to that
  which is used with the HTML DOM API.

# If an extended API is provided, then the Stableflow Platform
  MAY limit the scripting languages that can be used to those
  which are most convenient for the implementation. e.g. Python.

Model transformations for advanced systems engineering capabilities.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# If the Stableflow platform provides a measurement capability,
  then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to insert measurement nodes into the system
  of interest directed graph data structure.

Note that the term "measurement" is associated specifically 
with data collection for the purposes of exact and deterministic
re-simulation, and is distinct from "sampling", "logging", or
other forms of data collection which are used for different
purposes.

# If the Stableflow platform provides a re-simulation capability,
  then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to insert measurement replay nodes into the
  system of interest directed graph data structure.

# If the Stableflow platform provides a simulation capability,
  then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to insert synthetic data generation nodes
  into the system of interest directed graph data structure.

# If the Stableflow platform provides an adaptive simulation
  capability, then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of
  model transformations to insert measurement and synthetic
  data generation model tuning nodes into the system of
  interest directed graph data structure.

# If the Stableflow platform provides a "digital twin" capability,
  then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to insert sampling measurement, twin, and
  other relevant nodes into the system of interest directed
  graph data structure.

# If the Stableflow platform provides a "self aware" capability,
  then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to insert requirements analysis and performance
  monitoring nodes into the system of interest directed graph
  data structure.

# If the Stableflow platform provides a "design space exploration"
  capability, then the Stableflow platform SHOULD make use of model
  transformations to iteratively mutate the system of interest
  within specified constraints to evaluate the performance
  associated with different design permutations.

Regarding an established taxonomy of computational models for distributed,
parallel, and concurrent systems using message passing, there isn't a 
universally agreed-upon classification, but researchers have proposed broad
categories to organize these models:-

1. Process-Based Models

These models conceptualize the system as a set of processes (or threads of execution) interacting through message passing.

1.1 Kahn Process Networks (KPN)

	•	Core Idea: Processes communicate via unbounded FIFO queues with deterministic, blocking reads and asynchronous writes.
	•	Strengths: Deterministic behavior.
	•	Weaknesses: Unbounded memory use; no dynamic topology.

1.2 Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)

	•	Core Idea: Processes communicate via synchronous, blocking channels.
	•	Strengths: Strong synchronization, deterministic by design.
	•	Weaknesses: Performance bottlenecks in high-latency environments.

1.3 Actor Model

	•	Core Idea: Processes (actors) communicate asynchronously via message passing, with each actor processing messages one at a time.
	•	Strengths: Dynamic topology; high concurrency.
	•	Weaknesses: Non-deterministic; no inherent flow control.

2. Dataflow-Based Models

These models focus on computations as flows of data through a graph of nodes, typically combining functional and concurrent programming principles.

2.1 Dataflow Process Networks

	•	Core Idea: Processes are connected by channels with bounded buffers, and computations occur only when sufficient data is available.
	•	Strengths: Resource-bounded determinism.
	•	Weaknesses: Requires static analysis for boundedness.

2.2 Reactive Streams

	•	Core Idea: A model for asynchronous data streams with backpressure to prevent overwhelming slow consumers.
	•	Strengths: Bounded resources; dynamic handling of flow.
	•	Weaknesses: Complexity in managing backpressure in distributed setups.

3. Coordination-Based Models

These models focus on the coordination mechanisms between independent processes rather than direct communication.

3.1 Tuple Spaces (Linda Model)

	•	Core Idea: Processes communicate indirectly by placing, reading, or taking tuples in a shared space.
	•	Strengths: Decoupling in space and time; dynamic interaction patterns.
	•	Weaknesses: Non-deterministic access patterns.

3.2 Publish-Subscribe

	•	Core Idea: Decouples producers and consumers by routing messages through topics or channels.
	•	Strengths: Scalable; suitable for loosely coupled systems.
	•	Weaknesses: Lack of strict guarantees on ordering or delivery.

4. Event-Driven Models

These models rely on asynchronous event propagation for process communication.

4.1 Event Sourcing

	•	Core Idea: Communication occurs by appending events to a shared log, which other processes consume asynchronously.
	•	Strengths: Auditability; replayability.
	•	Weaknesses: Requires careful handling of distributed state consistency.

4.2 Discrete-Event Simulation

	•	Core Idea: Communication is modeled as the exchange of events, which are processed in logical or real-time order.
	•	Strengths: Suitable for simulation of complex, distributed systems.
	•	Weaknesses: May not scale well in real-time distributed systems.

5. Shared-State Message Passing Models

These models combine message passing with shared state, often involving fine-grained synchronization.

5.1 Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS)

	•	Core Idea: Processes share a distributed memory space with locality awareness and communicate via explicit messages.
	•	Strengths: Flexibility in combining message passing and shared state.
	•	Weaknesses: Complexity in managing synchronization.

5.2 Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)

	•	Core Idea: Processes perform computations and exchange messages in synchronized phases (supersteps).
	•	Strengths: Simplicity in reasoning about parallelism.
	•	Weaknesses: Less efficient for fine-grained communication.

6. Hybrid Models

These models blend features of multiple paradigms to address specific system requirements.

6.1 Workflow Systems

	•	Core Idea: Define tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with dependencies and use message passing for communication.
	•	Strengths: Suited for complex, task-oriented systems.
	•	Weaknesses: Not general-purpose; limited to DAG-like workflows.

6.2 MapReduce

	•	Core Idea: A data-parallel model where computation is divided into map (data transformation) and reduce (aggregation) phases.
	•	Strengths: Highly scalable for data-intensive applications.
	•	Weaknesses: Limited to batch processing; less flexible for general-purpose computing.

Key Dimensions of Taxonomy

When choosing a model, the taxonomy can be refined by these dimensions:
	1.	Determinism: Whether the model guarantees reproducible results.
	2.	Topology: Whether the system supports static or dynamic process interaction.
	3.	Synchronization: The degree of synchronization (blocking, non-blocking, or hybrid).
	4.	Flow Control: How resources (e.g., buffers) are managed.
	5.	Scalability: How well the model adapts to large-scale distributed systems.

For a more formal reference, you might explore seminal works like:
	•	“Models for Concurrency” by Robin Milner (introducing CCS).
	•	“Communicating Sequential Processes” by Tony Hoare.
	•	Kahn's original paper on Process Networks.
	•	Lamport's foundational works on distributed systems and logical clocks.

These provide rigorous foundations for computational model taxonomies.

title:
  "Reference control hierarchy tier register."


introduction:
  "This register holds a list of reference control
  hierarchy tiers with a brief description.

  In general, design elements managed at a tier
  with a higher numerical value are both intended
  and permitted to reference design elements
  managed at a tier with a lower numerical value.

  References in the other direction being either
  discouraged or disallowed."


register:

  h00_thirdparty:
    desc: "The h00_thirdparty tier is intended
          for design elements which are brought
          in from third parties and modified or
          customised by us in some way.

          Most third party dependencies will
          reside outside of the hierarchy and
          be incorporated into one or more
          managed environments, but in some
          cases we need to tailor or adapt
          those dependencies in some way, which
          means co-versioning them and managing
          them alongside our internally developed
          design elements.

          In principle, third party design
          elements should not depend on nor
          know about any internally developed
          design element."

  h10_resource:
    desc: "The h10_resource tier is intended for
          the management of static resources
          used across all products and product
          lines.

          This includes things like brand logo
          and pallette, document templates,
          organisation level registers and
          mini-databases, and anything else
          with a similar organisation-wide
          pattern of use."

  h20_functionality:
    desc: "The h20_functionality tier is intended
          for the management of design elements
          which are intended for generic reuse.

          This includes things like software
          libraries, APIs, dependency abstraction
          layers and other similar design
          elements.

          Most of the detailed design work should
          sit at this level of the hierarchy."

  h30_platform:
    desc: "The h30_platform tier is intended for
          the management of design elements
          which are intended for use as an
          enabling platform of some sort.

          This includes things like software
          frameworks and middleware.

          It is expected that design elements
          at the platform level will make use
          of detailed design elements managed
          at the h20_functionality level of the
          hierarchy."

  h40_component:
    desc: "The h40_component tier is intended for
          the management of design elements which
          are intended for reuse within the
          context of a component framework.

          It is expected that design elements
          at the component level will make use
          of detailed design elements managed
          at the h20_functionality level of the
          hierarchy as well as frameworks managed
          at the h30_platform level."

  h50_subsystem:
    desc: "The h50_subsystem tier is intended
          for the management of networks of
          components arranged in functional
          chains or similar agglomerations
          which provide some manageable subset
          of system functionality. The primary
          purpose of this level is to allow
          customisation of systems at a high
          level of abstraction.

          It is expected that design elements
          at the subsystem level will consist
          of configurations of components with
          associated scripts to enable them to
          be customised and integrated into
          larger systems."

  h60_system:
    desc: "The h60_system tier is intended for
          the management of systems of components
          and subsystems which are functionally
          complete but not tailored to the
          requirements of a specific customer.

          It is expected that design elements at
          the system level will consist of
          configurations of subsystems,
          components, and associated scripts
          which assemble all the pieces together
          into a functional whole."

  h70_bespoke:
    desc: "The h70_bespoke tier is intended for
          the management of designs of bespoke
          products.

          The designs in the h70_bespoke tier
          are normally composed of tailorings
          applied on top of off the shelf product
          designs drawn from the h60_system
          tier."

  h80_research:
    desc: "The h80_research tier is intended for
          the management of design elements that
          arise from research activities.

          The design elements managed in the
          h80_research tier are normally composed
          of tailorings and improvements that
          modify or replace design elements drawn
          from tiers at lower levels of the
          hierarchy."

  h90_internal:
    desc: "The h90_internal tier is intended for
          the management of design elements,
          programs, scripts, tools and utilities
          that are used to automate the design
          process itself, along with internal
          documentation, processes, and
          launchers for demonstrations of
          work in progress."

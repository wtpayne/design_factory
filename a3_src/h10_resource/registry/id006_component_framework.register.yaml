  cf00_stableflow:
    name:      "Stableflow."
    desc:      "The Stableflow component framework
               is an implementation of a Lee and
               Parks style dataflow process
               network with cyclostatic scheduling
               and large-grain components.

               It is intended to enable component
               based software development in a
               framework which is amenable to
               the introduction of highly
               automated design and analysis
               techniques."

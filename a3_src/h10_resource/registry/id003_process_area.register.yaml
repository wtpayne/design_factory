  "Team register"


introduction:
  "This register holds a list of process areas with
  a brief description for each."


register:

  a0_env:
    desc: "A repository of artifacts needed to
          create or reproduce a runtime, build
          or development environment. This
          consists of an archive of virtual
          machine disk images as well as any
          binary dependencies that may be used
          to create them. Vendored source files,
          documentation and other environment
          management resources are also stored
          here."

  a1_cfg:
    desc: "A repository of configuration files
          for individual users and specific
          devices. This area is intended to help
          support the ability to reproduce the
          working environment of individual team
          members - either to recover from a
          catastrophic failure or to reproduce
          and diagnose problems. This area was
          created because Eclipse configuration
          can affect the behaviour of the build
          but is at the same time both user and
          machine specific, making it unsuitable
          to store in the main part of the
          repository."

  a2_dat:
    desc: "A repository of data files for
          validation and training. This mainly
          consists of a systematic structure of
          symlinks to remote or local files,
          rather than files checked-in to the
          version control system."

  a3_src:
    desc: "A repository of design documents that
          act as the source of truth for system
          design configurations and the input to
          any production process."

  a4_tmp:
    desc: "A structured temporary storage area
          that provides a space for files created
          as a byproduct of an automated process."

  a5_cms:
    desc: "A structured repository for storing
          the generated output from our automated
          processes."

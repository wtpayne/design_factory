introduction:
  "This register holds a list of document types
  with a brief description for each."


register:

  dt000_bash_script:
    desc: |
      An executable script written in the Bash
      programming language.

  dt001_python_script:
    desc: |
      An executable script written in the Python
      programming language.

  dt002_python_package:
    desc: |
      A package of modules written in the Python
      programming language.

  dt003_python_module:
    desc: |
      A module written in the Python programming
      language.

  dt004_python_stableflow_edict_component:
    desc: |
      An ic00_edict compliant component for the
      cf00_stableflow framework written in the
      Python programming language.

  dt005_software_development_plan:
    desc: |
      The Software Development Plan (SDP)
      describes a developer's plans for conducting
      a software development effort. The term
      “software development” is meant to include
      the new development, modification, reuse,
      reengineering, incorporation of commercial
      item (also known as COTS) packages,
      maintenance, and all other activities
      resulting in software products. The SDP
      provides the acquirer insight into, and a
      tool for monitoring, the processes to be
      followed for software development; the
      methods to be used; the approach to be
      followed for each activity; and project
      schedules, organization, and resources.

  dt006_software_architecture_description:
    desc: |
      The Software Architecture Description (SAD)
      documents the software architecture,
      including the approach, important design
      decisions, rationale, and tradeoffs. It
      provides diagrams and text to document the
      various architectural views from different
      perspectives and serves as the basis for
      the detailed design.

  dt007_software_master_build_plan:
    desc: |
      The Software Master Build Plan (SMBP)
      includes plans for integrating and verifying
      the software consistent with the software
      development lifecycle model(s). (The SMBP
      is sometimes known as the Master Software
      Integration and Verification Plan.)

  dt008_software_measurement_plan:
    desc: |
      The Software Measurement Plan (SMP) is an
      integrated plan covering the software
      development measurement activities for all
      software team members throughout the system
      development. The SMP provides the planned
      metrics and their aggregation levels,
      explanations of computation, expected or
      projected values, thresholds, and any
      planned corrective actions to be taken
      in case thresholds are breached.

  dt009_software_measurement_report:
    desc: |
     Each Software Measurement Report (SMR) is an
     integrated report covering the software
     development activities for all significant
     software team members throughout the system
     development. The SMR provides explanations
     and interpretations of reported measurement
     data, including deviations from expected or
     projected values and breaches of thresholds
     as well as any corrective actions being
     undertaken. The software measurements
     collected and reported each month are
     expected to vary because the lifecycle
     activities vary over time.

  dt010_process_improvement_plan:
    desc: |
     The Process Improvement Plan (PIP) is an
     integrated plan covering the software
     development process improvement activities
     for all software team members throughout the
     system development life cycle. The PIP
     provides the plans and activities to improve
     the processes on the project based on
     process assessments conducted by the
     acquirer team or the developer team or
     both.

    Return a list of rasterized pages from the specified PDF data buffer.

    To avoid the device-dependent effects of
    specifying objects in device space, the
    ISO 23000-2:2020 PDF 2.0 standard defines
    a device independent coordinate system that
    always bears the same relationship to the
    current page, regardless of the output
    device on which printing or displaying
    occurs.

    This device-independent coordinate system
    is called user space. The length of a unit
    along both the x and y axes of user space
    is set by the UserUnit entry in the page
    dictionary.

    If that entry is not present or supported,
    the default value of 1 ‚ÅÑ 72 inch is used.

    This coordinate system is called default
    user space.

    For the purposes of this function, we
    assume that default user space is being
    used.

    In future, we may wish to interrogate
    the PDF to find out if a custom user
    space has been specified.

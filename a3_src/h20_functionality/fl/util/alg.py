    Generate depth-first traversal over tree of mappings and other iterables.

    This function performs a depth-first,
    left-to-right recursive traversal over
    the provided data structure, which is
    assumed to consist of a finite, treelike
    arrangement of nested collections.Mapping
    and collections.Iterable types.

    The function can be configured to yield
    information about nodes in the tree:
    leaf nodes, non-leaf (internal) nodes,
    or both. Additionally, the information
    yielded can be configured to include
    the path to the node and/or the object
    at the node itself.

    Adapted from:

        {http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577982-recursively-walk-python-objects/}

    Parameters:

        obj (object):                       The object to be traversed.

        gen_leaf (bool, optional):          If True, leaf nodes will be
                                            generated. Default is False.

        gen_nonleaf (bool, optional):       If True, non-leaf nodes will be
                                            generated. Default is False.

        gen_path (bool, optional):          If True, the path to the node will
                                            be generated. Default is False.

        gen_obj (bool, optional):           If True, the object at the node
                                            will be generated. Default is
                                            False.

        use_fat_leaves (bool, optional):    If True, simple data structures
                                            like lists or tuples of integers
                                            will be considered as leaf rather
                                            than nonleaf nodes.

        path (tuple, optional):             A tuple representing the path to
                                            the current node. Default is an
                                            empty tuple.

        memo (set, optional):               A set used to track visited objects
                                            to avoid infinite recursion.

    Yields:

        tuple or object:                    The configured information for each
                                            node in the traversal.

    Examples:

        >>> data = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': [3, 4]}}
        >>> list(walk(data, gen_leaf=True, gen_path=True))

    Return True if obj is a leaf data type, False otherwise.

    The function identifies a 'leaf' as a data
    type which doesn't contain any nested types.

    Certain types are always considered 'leaves',
    such as strings, int, float, bool, generators,
    and coroutines.

    Certain types are never considered 'leaves',
    such as collections.abc.Mapping types.

    If 'use_fat_leaves' is set to True, simple
    lists and tuples containing only fundamental
    numeric types or strings are also considered
    to be 'leaves'.

    Parameters:

        obj (object):                    The object to be evaluated.

        use_fat_leaves (bool, optional): Indicates if simple lists and tuples

                                         types or strings should also be
